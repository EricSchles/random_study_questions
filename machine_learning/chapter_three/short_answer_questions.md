1. Define a binary classifier.  Give examples of two binary classifiers.

2. Define multiclass classifier.  Give examples of two truly multiclass classifiers.  What strategies could you employ to make binary classifiers multi class?  

3. What is multilabel classification?  Define a learning problem where you would want this.  You'll need to define the task you are learning, the input, and the output.  You can treat the classifier as a classifier.

4. What is multioutput classification?  Define a learning problem where you would want this.  You'll need to define the task you are learning, the input, and the output.  You can treat the classifier as a classifier.

5. Define precision.  Please include the formula, at least a one sentence description, and an example when you care about precision the most.

6. Define recall.  Please include the formula, at least a one sentence description, and an example when you care about recall the most.

7. Define f1 score.  Please include the formula, at least a one sentence description, and an example when you care about f1 score the most.

8. Define Reciever Operator Curve.  Please include the formula, at least a one sentence description, and an example when you care about ROC the most.

9. Define Reciever Operator Curve Area Under the Curve.  Please include the formula, at least a one sentence description, and an example when you care about ROC AUC the most.
