1. Define Machine Learning, give an example of a system that you use that makes use of machine learning.  What kind of learning system is at work?  Try to figure out if it's supervised, semi supervised, unsupervised or self supervised learning that's taking place.  How might you architect this system?

2.  Given the definition of a machine learning as:

"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P improves with experience E."

Can you come up with three examples of applications that could be accomplished from machine learning?  Please provide 2-3 sentences describing the learning problem, defining E, T and P as above.

3. The chapter mentions the importance of having enough data and having the right data so that generalization is possible.  Come up with two examples of your own for this in the context of decision making generally.  When might having not enough data matter for making a decision?  When might having a non-repersentative amount of data matter for making a decision?

4. Come up with a definition for degrees of freedom within the context of a model.  

5. Explain why regularization can be important.  When might you want to regularize your model.  When might you not want to?

6. Suppose you train a machine learning model and then validate it's ability to generalize against a training set.  How confident should you be in the model?  Say you then validate against a second test set and the model isn't as accurate, should you be concerned?  How might you adjust your model to deal with this drop in accuracy?

7. Why is the no free lunch theorem important?
